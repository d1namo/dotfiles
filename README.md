My setup is Archlinux with i3.  I have a remastered arch iso setup this way available at

# Also included so I don't have to make seperate repo's:

### 'adblock.sh' -  script that pulls hosts files from multiple url's and strips/sorts for usage with something like dnsmasq/pihole.

### 'i3screen' - very simple, short script to grab screenshot of each i3 workspace, and then append them to 1 large pic.  Uses 'maim' and 'imagemagick', so just adapt to your tool of preference.
