# Also included so I don't have to make seperate repo's:

### 'adblock.sh' -  script that pulls hosts files from multiple url's and strips/sorts for usage with something like dnsmasq/pihole.

### '2gif' - script that uses ffmpeg and gifsicle-lossy (AUR) to convert video to gif.  run '2gif' for parameters.  Can use original gifsicle if you remove the --lossy parameters, but it really does help with compressing those huge ass gifs.

### 'meme' - Just a little script to add top, and or bottom text to an image.  Included the best font for this, 'Impact'.
