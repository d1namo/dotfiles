# :wrench: .files

_Simple snapshot of my dotfiles_

Also included so I don't have to make seperate repo's:
adblock.sh -  script that pulls hosts files from multiple url's and strips/sorts for usage with something like dnsmasq/pihole.

2gif - uses ffmpeg and gifsicle-lossy (AUR) to convert video to gif
